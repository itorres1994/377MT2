\chapter{Monitors and Condition Variables}

\section{What's wrong with \defn{semaphors}?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item are shared global variables
    \item no linguistic connection between semaphores and data they control
    \item can be accessed from anywhere
    \item dual purposed (mutex and sched constraints)
    \item no guarantee of proper usage
\end{itemize}

Solution: use a higher level construct

\section{Monitors}
A monitor is similar to a class that ties data/operations and
synchornization together. \\

They differ from classes by guaranteeing mutual exlusion and requiring all data
to be private.

\begin{dfn} 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item (From Wikipedia) A \defn{monitor} is a synchronization construct
            that allows threads to have both mutual exclusion and the ability to
            wait (block) for a certain condition to become true.
        \item (From slides) A \emph{monitor} is a defines a \emph{lock} and zero
            or more \emph{condition variables} for managing concurrent access to
            shared data.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Monitors use a \emph{lock} to ensure that only a single
                    thread is active in the monitor at a given time
                \item The \emph{lock} also provides mutual exclusion for shared
                    data
                \item \emph{Condition variables} enable threads to go to sleep
                    inside the critical sections, by releasing their lock at the
                    same time it puts the thread to sleep

            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{dfn}

Monitor Operations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Encapsulates shared date to protect
    \item Acquires the mutex at start
    \item Operates on the shared data
    \item Temporarily release mutex if it can't complete
    \item Reqcquires the mutex when it can continue
    \item Releases the mutex at the end
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementing Monitors in Java}

It is simple to turn a Java class into a monitor:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Make all data private
    \item Make all methods synchronized (or at least the non-private ones)
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
class Queue{
    private data;     // queue data

    public void synchronized Add(Object item) {
        put item on queue;
    }

    public void synchronized Remove(){
        if (queue not empty){
            remove item;
            return item;
        }
    }
}
\end{verbatim}
