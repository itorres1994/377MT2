\chapter{Monitors and Condition Variables}

\section{What's wrong with \defn{semaphors}?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item are shared global variables
    \item no linguistic connection between semaphores and data they control
    \item can be accessed from anywhere
    \item dual purposed (mutex and sched constraints)
    \item no guarantee of proper usage
\end{itemize}

Solution: use a higher level construct

\section{Monitors}
A monitor is similar to a class that ties data/operations and
synchornization together. \\

They differ from classes by guaranteeing mutual exlusion and requiring all data
to be private.

\begin{dfn} 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item (From Wikipedia) A \defn{monitor} is a synchronization construct
            that allows threads to have both mutual exclusion and the ability to
            wait (block) for a certain condition to become true.
        \item (From slides) A \emph{monitor} is a defines a \emph{lock} and zero
            or more \emph{condition variables} for managing concurrent access to
            shared data.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{dfn}
